// 1. Unary Operators: These operators work with a single operand. They perform operations on 
//                 a single value or variable.

// Example 1:- 
   let x = "5";
   let y = +x; 

// Example 2:-
   let count = 5;
   count++; 
   count--; 

// 2. Binary Operators: These operators work with two operands. They perform operations that require two values 
//                 to be compared or combined.

// Example:-
   let sum = 3 + 5
   let sub = 6 - 2
   let multi = 6 * 7; 

// 3. Ternary Operator: The ternary operator is the only ternary operator in JavaScript, and it works with three 
//                 operands. It's a conditional operator used for decision-making.

// Example:-
    let age = 16;
    let result = (age<18) ? "Not 18+" : "18+";
